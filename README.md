# Google-Playstore-Dataset-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis Project

This project aims at implementing various steps that are a part of EDA and finally reaching some conclusions.

Here the dataset containing reviews of applications present on Google Playstore has been used. It has been understood, cleaned and then processed to reach conclusions upon what kind of apps should one deploy on playstore, as well as, how to handle apps already deployed on playstore.

## Language Used
Python

## Platform Used
Jupyter Notebook
